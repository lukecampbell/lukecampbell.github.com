<h1>AppleScript and Copying</h1>

<p> <p class='meta'>21 January 2012</p>
Oh my lord! I cannot begin to tell you how much of a pain I have experienced trying to do the most simple task one can do! What I wanted to do was simply to <b>copy a file</b> to a destination while having a window display the status of the transfer (using Finder's copying window). Seeing as how I've had some experience working on a Mac, the obvious choice is Applescript.</p>

<p>I have a local NFS server that has various files I work with and I wanted to be able to see a window of the file copying to the local file system, on Linux the solution was quite simple however on here the solution was a little obfuscated in Applescript. After several hours of tinkering and tweaking I came up with this:</p>

<p><i>gcopy</i></p>

<pre>
    #!/bin/bash

    osascript&lt;&lt;EOF
    tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
      set sfile to (POSIX file &quot;$PWD/$1&quot;)
      set sdest to (POSIX file &quot;$2&quot;)
      duplicate file sfile to folder sdest with replacing
    end tell
    EOF
</pre>


<p>Obviously there's room for a LOT of improvement here. I think that with some assistance from my friend Ruby I might be able to make something really nice, unfortunately Applescript doesn't like me one bit!</p>

<p>The things to watch out for this difference between Posix paths and HFS Paths (which Applescript) understands. <a href="http://whitefiles.org/b1_s/1_free_guides/fg3mo/pgs/v03.htm">Here is a nice tutorial</a> on dealing with folders in Applescript, as well as the POSIX conversion technique I adopted from <a href='http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/AppleScript_Programming/Aliases_and_paths'>here</a>.</p>
